1
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:27,769

它来自庭院。

2
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:35,276

这是主指挥官！

3
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,325

帮我把他带到里面。

4
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:47,549

索恩这样做。

5
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:55,023

你认为你可以信任多少兄弟？

6
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:56,724

信任？

7
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,196

在这个房间里的人。

8
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:05,150

狼认识你吗？

9
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:07,235

我们需要所有的帮助，我们可以得到。

10
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:15,577

戴佛斯爵士。

11
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:00,455

我看见他在火焰里

12
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,707

战斗在临冬城。

13
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,880

我不能说话的火焰…

14
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600

但他走了。

15
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:34,489

他是我们的主指挥官。

16
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,407

他从来没有过！

17
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:42,086

你都知道你为什么在这里。

18
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:47,885

乔恩雪死了。

19
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:49,170

谁杀了他？

20
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:52,140

我干的他。

21
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,509

是谁UIUI

22
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,894

以及这座城堡里的其他军官。

23
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:58,680

张旭！  黄泽贤！

24
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,736

干他娘的

25
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:07,071

我们犯了叛国罪，我们所有人。

26
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,275

他俩只是喜欢搞比利！！！！！

27
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:13,077

我了大大去！！！

28
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,530

这不是秘密。

29
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:19,867

但我从来没有一次违抗了命令。

30
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:22,370

忠诚是基础。

31
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:24,505

守夜人永不为男奴！！！！！

32
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,958

守夜人对我来说意味着一切！

33
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:29,010

我放弃了我的性生活！

34
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:33,214

我们已经将我们的生命都给了夜晚的手。

35
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:40,104

张旭的死会破坏守夜人内的激情。

36
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:42,807

他让野人通过我们的大门。

37
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:46,361

因为没有主指挥官曾经做过。

38
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:51,232

他给了他们抢走的土地。

39
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:55,069

强奸犯，连孩子都不放过。

40
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:59,407

主指挥官雪做了他认为是正确的，

41
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:02,410

俺没有意见。

42
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:06,714

他认为是对的，将是我们的结束。

43
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,001

他认为是对的，将是我们的结束。

44
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,254

我们干了它。

45
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:27,268

他会看到我们没有来。

46
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,437

索恩会使官员现在。

47
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,022

Castle Black is his.

48
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:34,275

I don't care who's sitting at the high table.

49
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:35,943

Jon was my friend.

50
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,247

And those fuckers butchered him.

51
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,783

Now we return the favor.

52
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:43,284

We don't have the numbers.

53
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,336

- We have a direwolf. - It's not enough.

54
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:47,455

I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long,

55
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,556

but I have to believe he

56
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:50,758

wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing.

57
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:55,346

If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room.

58
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:57,632

We all die today.

59
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,435

I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.

60
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,938

We need to fight, but we don't need to die.

61
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,441

- Not if we have help. - Who is gonna help us?

62
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:09,894

You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.

63
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,821

Bolt the door.

64
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,823

Don't let anyone in.

65
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,991

I'll be back as soon as I can.

66
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:37,255

She was 11 the first time I saw her.

67
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:42,009

The kennelmaster's daughter.

68
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,431

She smelled of dog.

69
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:53,354

I wasn't much older, but everybody was already afraid of me.

70
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:57,024

You certainly were.

71
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:04,031

Myranda wasn't, though.

72
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:08,002

What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't?

73
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,954

She was fearless.

74
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,707

There was nothing she wouldn't do.

75
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:22,216

Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over.

76
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:27,889

I wish you could be here to watch.

77
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:35,813

Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord?

78
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,318

Or would you rather the men build a pyre?

79
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,458

Buried, burned?

80
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:49,210

This is good meat.

81
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,745

Feed it to the hounds.

82
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,466

Your command of the cavalry was impressive.

83
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:58,469

Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead.

84
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:01,222

Do you know who struck the killing blow?

85
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:03,307

- No. - A shame.

86
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:05,309

I'd reward the man.

87
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:08,729

Still, a great victory.

88
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:10,848

Do you feel like a victor?

89
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,822

I rebelled against the crown

90
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,991

to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.

91
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:22,610

Do you think that burning wagons in the night

92
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,946

and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons

93
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:28,366

is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?

94
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:32,870

No.

95
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:36,457

A reckoning will come.

96
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:38,175

We need the North to face it.

97
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,127

The entire North.

98
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:43,464

They won't back us without Sansa Stark.

99
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:47,218

We no longer have Sansa Stark.

100
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,520

You played your games with her.

101
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,935

You played your games with the

102
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:53,140

heir to the Iron Islands and now they're both gone.

103
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:56,143

I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds.

104
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:57,778

They won't get far.

105
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:59,864

I'm glad to hear it.

106
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:03,284

Without Sansa, you won't be able to produce an heir.

107
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:06,454

And without an heir, well...

108
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,626

let's hope the maesters are right

109
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,628

and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

110
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:35,983

We can't stop.

111
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:56,203

We have to cross here.

112
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,792

- I can't. - It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

113
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:04,428

But it's too cold. I can't. I won't make it. I'll die.

114
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:07,048

I've seen what his hounds do to a person.

115
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,133

This way is better.

116
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,751

Over here. Come on.

117
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:00,518

Sansa.

118
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,571

Sansa.

119
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,761

Tell them to settle down!

120
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:28,095

Stay here. I'll lure them away.

121
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:30,297

No, I won't make it without you.

122
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,133

You will.

123
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,468

Go north, only north.

124
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,387

Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.

125
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,139

He'll help you.

126
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,867

See somebody, eh?

127
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:52,486

- There they are! - Get them!

128
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,492

Where is Lady Bolton?

129
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,495

- Dead. - Liar.

130
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,832

She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts.

131
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,001

I left her to die in the snow.

132
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,974

Got something! Run!

133
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,595

Hyah!

134
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:28,439

Resist. Stay.

135
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:32,526

Stay.

136
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:36,864

I can't wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.

137
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,541

Rider! Who is it?

138
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:50,177

It's a bloody woman.

139
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,780

No! Please!

140
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:55,920

Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again.

141
00:17:57,506 --> 00:17:59,673

I will shield your back and keep your counsel

142
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,009

and give my life for yours if need be.

143
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:05,679

I swear it by the old gods and the new.

144
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:17,491

And I vow...

145
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:22,696

that you shall always have a place by my hearth

146
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:24,665

and...

147
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:28,619

Meat and mead at my table.

148
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:30,871

...meat and mead at my table.

149
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:37,962

And I pledge to ask no service of you

150
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,547

that might bring you dishonor.

151
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:43,884

I swear it by the old gods and the new.

152
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:46,971

Arise.

153
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:35,569

Your Grace, I'm sorry to disturb you.

154
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:38,238

A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor.

155
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:41,358

Myrcella.

156
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:57,351

Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?

157
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:00,354

Mother.

158
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:04,358

All I could think about when she died

159
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:06,660

was what would happen to her now.

160
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:13,283

Every day, every night,

161
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,702

what does Mama look like now?

162
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,340

Has she started to bloat?

163
00:21:21,877 --> 00:21:24,378

Has her skin turned black?

164
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:28,549

Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?

165
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:36,390

I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.

166
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:40,777

I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.

167
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:44,064

Shh, shh. Don't think about it.

168
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,866

I have to.

169
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:50,037

I have to. It's not right she has to suffer alone.

170
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:53,373

She's not suffering. She's gone.

171
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:56,326

No one can hurt her anymore.

172
00:21:57,913 --> 00:21:59,713

She was good.

173
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,001

From her first breath, she was so sweet.

174
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:07,754

I don't know where she came from.

175
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:12,759

She was nothing like me.

176
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,312

No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

177
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,097

I know.

178
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:21,435

I thought if I could make something so good,

179
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,104

so pure...

180
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:29,443

- maybe I'm not a monster. - Listen... listen to me.

181
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:32,079

She was my daughter and I failed her.

182
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:34,665

No, I knew this would happen.

183
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,917

The witch told me years ago.

184
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:41,955

She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.

185
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,625

"And gold their shrouds."

186
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,293

Everything she said came true.

187
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:48,128

You couldn't have stopped it.

188
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:49,880

It's prophecy. It's fate.

189
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:52,966

- You don't believe that. - Of course I do.

190
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:56,220

You told me yourself when Father died.

191
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:58,188

You said we had to stay together.

192
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:01,525

You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours.

193
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:03,143

That was a prophecy, too.

194
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,529

I didn't listen to you and everything you said came true.

195
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:08,065

Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate.

196
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,534

Fuck everyone who isn't us.

197
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:12,152

We're the only ones who matter,

198
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:14,371

the only ones in this world.

199
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,930

And everything they've taken from us,

200
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,075

we're going to take back and more.

201
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:23,330

We're going to take everything there is.

202
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:34,308

"The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men.

203
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:37,227

They scream in agony and their shame is so great,

204
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:39,313

they do not feel the flames,

205
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:42,316

for now they see if not for a single sin

206
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:45,152

they concealed, they were saved."

207
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:47,154

I'd like to see my brother.

208
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,523

- Confess. - Please.

209
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:51,608

How is he? At least tell me that.

210
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:53,026

Confess.

211
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,199

I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.

212
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:01,285

Sinners don't make demands.

213
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,087

They make confessions.

214
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,843

Septa Unella.

215
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:12,796

Our other guests need you.

216
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:26,059

There.

217
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:30,897

Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.

218
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,399

I'll speak with her.

219
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:37,204

My brother, can you tell me how he is?

220
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:42,909

It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.

221
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:46,079

Your husband misses you dearly.

222
00:24:46,215 --> 00:24:50,217

The love between a man and wife is sacred.

223
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:53,470

It reflects the love the gods have for all of us.

224
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:58,058

But sin leads us away from the sacred.

225
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:00,977

And only confession can purge sin.

226
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:03,764

I have nothing to confess.

227
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,485

So you believe you are pure?

228
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:10,437

Perfect?

229
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:12,906

Wholly without sin?

230
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:15,609

None of us are.

231
00:25:17,613 --> 00:25:20,364

You have started down the path.

232
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,950

But you have many miles to go.

233
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:40,550

I always envied Oberyn.

234
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:42,352

He lived.

235
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:44,054

He truly lived.

236
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:45,972

Sailed around the world.

237
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:47,974

Fought men from every country.

238
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,477

Lay with the most beautiful women alive.

239
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:52,646

- And men. - And men.

240
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:55,315

He experienced everything

241
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:58,318

while I sat here in Dorne

242
00:25:58,404 --> 00:26:03,323

trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed.

243
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,158

But that is life.

244
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,879

We each have our roles.

245
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:13,750

Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

246
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:15,719

And I was born to rule.

247
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:17,587

The gods are not fools.

248
00:26:17,673 --> 00:26:20,557

You would have been a lousy adventurer.

249
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:23,143

And Oberyn, pfft,

250
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,928

he would have been a terrible ruler.

251
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:28,398

Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?

252
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:30,817

Prince Doran.

253
00:26:42,698 --> 00:26:44,664

The Princess Myrcella.

254
00:27:03,385 --> 00:27:05,802

When was the last time you left this palace?

255
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:08,221

You don't know your own people.

256
00:27:08,357 --> 00:27:11,558

Their disgust for you.

257
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:15,562

Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing.

258
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:20,233

Oberyn Martell butchered, and you did nothing.

259
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,037

You're not a Dornishman.

260
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:27,374

You're not our prince.

261
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:31,745

My son Trystane...

262
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,816

Your son is weak just like you.

263
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:40,987

And weak men will never rule Dorne again.

264
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:06,263

I told you I'm not hungry.

265
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:08,515

We're not here to feed you.

266
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:12,719

We're here to kill you.

267
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:15,522

You want her to do it or me?

268
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:19,226

We are family. I don't want to hurt you.

269
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:22,062

Her or me?

270
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:27,651

You.

271
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:29,619

Good.

272
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:32,072

Smart boy.

273
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:51,258

You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

274
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:01,735

We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city

275
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,354

from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.

276
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,856

We'll be fine.

277
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:09,442

We're dressed like common merchants.

278
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,363

You walk like a rich person.

279
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:16,416

You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?

280
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:20,503

You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property.

281
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:23,790

I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.

282
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,925

It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore.

283
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:29,629

Because you have no cock.

284
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,172

_

285
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:46,157

_

286
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,483

She thinks you want to eat her baby.

287
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:53,320

_

288
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:56,298

_

289
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,267

_

290
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:16,843

- Mhysa means mother in Valyrian. - I know what mhysa means.

291
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:18,812

- Who wrote it? - Hard to know.

292
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:22,432

Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.

293
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:24,267

The Sons of the Harpy?

294
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:25,935

Very possibly.

295
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:30,740

Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property,

296
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:34,778

told them human beings weren't even property to begin with.

297
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:37,030

You can see why they're unhappy.

298
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:39,416

Of course,

299
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:42,202

it could also be the freed men.

300
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:45,705

_

301
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:50,043

_

302
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,247

_

303
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:57,100

Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.

304
00:30:57,896 --> 00:31:00,553

She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.

305
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:03,240

_

306
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:09,139

_

307
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:13,007

_

308
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:17,869

_

309
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:20,407

It's a problem.

310
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:25,078

Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill.

311
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,299

Whoever you are, wherever you go,

312
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:32,585

someone in this city wants to murder you.

313
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:35,672

We can't fight an enemy we don't know.

314
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:39,189

The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack

315
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:41,141

in the fighting pits very carefully,

316
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:43,894

which means they take orders from someone.

317
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,113

And have you started looking for that someone?

318
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:48,983

My little birds have already taken wing.

319
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:53,570

Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.

320
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:32,443

Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.

321
00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:56,266

Goat?

322
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:57,968

Ram.

323
00:32:58,054 --> 00:32:59,720

You think our friend got him?

324
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:04,141

Don't know anything else that can melt a ram's horn.

325
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:08,395

We're on the right path, then.

326
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:11,615

Perhaps she's tired of being queen.

327
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:13,784

I don't think she likes it very much.

328
00:33:13,903 --> 00:33:16,070

She's too smart to like it.

329
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,988

Maybe she's flown somewhere else,

330
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:20,074

somewhere far away from men like us.

331
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,993

I've been all over the world.

332
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,995

There's no escaping men like us.

333
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:27,798

There's no escaping her, eh?

334
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:31,085

You keep coming back. Why?

335
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,669

You know why.

336
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,757

Isn't it frustrating

337
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:40,260

wanting someone who doesn't want you back?

338
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:41,812

Of course it is.

339
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:44,481

You're a romantic. I admire that.

340
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,567

Sometimes I look at you and I think,

341
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,986

"So that's what I'll be like when I grow old."

342
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:50,771

If you grow old.

343
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:52,106

If I grow old.

344
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,408

I hope I do.

345
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,243

I want to see what the world looks like

346
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:57,945

when she's done conquering it.

347
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080

So do I.

348
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:22,553

Huh, an army?

349
00:34:22,638 --> 00:34:24,054

Not an army.

350
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,889

A horde.

351
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,749

Dothraki?

352
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:17,858

They have her.

353
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,077

_

354
00:36:10,343 --> 00:36:12,440

_

355
00:36:12,745 --> 00:36:15,323

_

356
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:17,986

_

357
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:21,278

_

358
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:24,673

_

359
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:26,995

_

360
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:29,195

_

361
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:35,339

_

362
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:37,312

_

363
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:41,513

_

364
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:45,323

_

365
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:50,756

_

366
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:25,118

No.

367
00:37:40,523 --> 00:37:42,571

_

368
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:45,893

_

369
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,130

_

417
00:41:10,408 --> 00:41:13,343

_

418
00:41:49,585 --> 00:41:51,918

But there has to be a price to pay for everything.

419
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:55,622

I know, but have you tried telling him that?

420
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:05,515

Thank you.

421
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:08,151

Who'd go there after what happened to that Kingsguard?

422
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,936

- Probably had it coming. - Maybe so,

423
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:11,655

but I'm not risking it.

424
00:42:11,773 --> 00:42:13,356

- Just can't do it. - All right.

425
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:15,859

Honesty as well. He gets it.

426
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:22,449

Are you listening, blind girl?

427
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,786

Do you hear them talking?

428
00:42:26,872 --> 00:42:29,589

Do any of them talk to you?

429
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,091

No.

430
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,044

So sad.

431
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:43,219

Stand and fight, blind girl.

432
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:46,439

I can't see.

433
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,642

That's your problem, not mine.

434
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:18,338

See you tomorrow.

435
00:44:10,392 --> 00:44:14,277

Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.

436
00:44:14,396 --> 00:44:16,529

We are both anointed knights.

437
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:20,200

Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.

438
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,452

I will grant amnesty to all brothers

439
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:24,904

who throw down their arms before nightfall.

440
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,625

And you, Ser Davos, I will allow you to travel south

441
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:31,578

a free man with a fresh horse.

442
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:35,298

And some mutton.

443
00:44:35,417 --> 00:44:36,966

I'd like some mutton.

444
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:40,887

- What? - I'm not much of a hunter.

445
00:44:40,972 --> 00:44:44,591

I'll need some food if I'm gonna make it south without starving.

446
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:50,597

We'll give you food.

447
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:53,900

You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like.

448
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:57,437

Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose.

449
00:44:57,522 --> 00:45:02,358

But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.

450
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,829

Thank you, Ser Alliser.

451
00:45:05,947 --> 00:45:07,243

We'll discuss amongst

452
00:45:07,244 --> 00:45:10,083

ourselves and come back to you with an answer.

453
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:29,385

Boys, I've been running from men like that all my life.

454
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,639

In my learned opinion, we open that door...

455
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:34,190

And they'll slaughter us all.

456
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:36,609

They want to come in, they're gonna come in.

457
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:37,955

- Aye, but we don't need to

458
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:40,196

make it easy for them. - Edd is our only chance.

459
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:43,650

It's a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

460
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:47,153

There's always the Red Woman.

461
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,956

What's one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?

462
00:45:51,576 --> 00:45:53,793

You haven't seen her do what I've seen her do.
